# tinyCamML (Spatial Extent of Sunny Day Flooding)
The tinyCamML is a camera sensor module that analyzes the extent of flooding. It sends the data over LoRa to the Gateway Module where it is uploaded to the cloud. This unit houses an OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and Sparrow Essentials Board.

## ML Pipeline
Included are notebooks for training, testing, and quantizing MobileNetV2 based models for binary classification and segmentation based models of flood detection. 

## Camera Module
Included are deployable MicroPython files for the OpenMV Cam H7.

## Communications Hub
Documentation for the communications hub will be available soon.
